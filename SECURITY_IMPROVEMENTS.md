## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Subscription Bypass Removed**

- Now properly validates subscriptions against Stripe on every check
- No more skipping validation for "demo" accounts

### 2. **Email Harvesting Protection**
- Removed email column from profiles table to prevent harvesting
- Updated RLS policies to prevent profile enumeration
- Only users can view their own profile data

### 3. **Input Validation Added**
- Created comprehensive validation schemas using Zod
- Added validation for auth forms (email/password)
- Added validation for chat messages and idea inputs
- Implemented XSS protection with input sanitization

### 4. **CORS Headers Improved**
- Added configurable allowed origins for edge functions
- Implemented proper CORS preflight handling
- Added cache control headers

### 5. **Rate Limiting Foundation**
- Added RateLimiter class for future implementation
- Can be used to prevent API abuse and brute force attacks

## ⚠️ Remaining Security Recommendations

### Enable Leaked Password Protection
Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Password Settings and enable "Leaked password protection"

### Monitor Security
- Regularly check Supabase security logs
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Keep dependencies updated

### Additional Hardening
- Consider implementing rate limiting on edge functions
- Add API key rotation schedule
- Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations
